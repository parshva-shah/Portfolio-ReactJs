                    <p>The controversial Paathshala is a place for learning. We are a safe space where  people with similar interests share their opinions on an ongoing issue , controversy or crisis.We facilitate this exchange of opinions through Real time , face-to-face physical interactions at certain venues. In light of COVID-19 , and in accordance to the social distancing norms issued by the National Government and The World Health Organization , sessions will be held via virtual video conferencing portals.</p>

                    <p>Everyone has a different opinion . We are not here to prove someone wrong , we are here to understand other people's thought processes and share our strengths. No member discussing a topic is going to prove his/her opinion. If you know it all , we are too meager a platform for you. This is no democracy. No party is winning . This is communism . We share and understand opinions , we don't vote on the validity of an opinion.
